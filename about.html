    <p>The organization is here to help with any type of questions individuals might have on various topics such as: wrongful termination, workplace descrimination, and several miscellaneous rights that those with disabilities possess. We hope that our organization will be helpful in gaining knowledge on said topics.</p>

    <p>If you are someone without a disability, visiting our site, we hope that you gained the knowledge you were seeking. We strive to inform any and all Americans of the various rights an individual with disabilities possesses as a citizen of the USA. In our country, we are all afforded the same rights, and these laws are set in place to make things a bit more equal. </p>
