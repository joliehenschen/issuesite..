        <h4>Wisconsin Wal-Mart Fires Employee with Down Syndrome</h4>
        <h8>According to an article written for CNBC, Marlo Spaeth had worked at his local Wal-Mart for nearly 16 years. A disibility rights attorney suspects this is not an isolated incident, but part of a pattern to keep disabled peoples from working. The attorney, Monica Murphy, says she has recently represented six different Wisconsin residents with disabilities who have faced similar instances with the Wal-Mart Corporation. These former employees have suffered their hours being taken away and forced to take unpaid leave. Wal-Mart was found to be violating federal law, and an exceptionally large pay-out occured. </h8>

        <h4>A Personal Story from a Reader</h4>
        <h8>Hello everyone, my name is Gina Thompson. I have used a wheelchair for the past 8 years. In May 2014, I was involved in a horrible car accident. So, I lost the ability to use my legs. Recently, I applied for a job with a local retail store and I was so excited to start work.</h8> 
        <br>
        <br>
       <h8> I was there for about a month and the entire time I felt like I was constantly in the way. I was unable to put clothes away from fitting rooms, unable to move through the many rack of clothes, I could not reach most things at the registers, and the customer service counter was much too high for me. I was constantle catching rude glances and stares from my fellow coworkers and some of my managers. They started saying things like, "Can you even do that, Gina?" and "Hey Gina, your chair is kind of in the way, can you move?" and when I was interviewing for the job the manager said, "I guess we can find something for you to do". They started asking me to give uo shifts and wondering if I would change my avilibility to fewer days. These words and actions seriously hurt me and made me mad after the fact. After reading about my rights, I have realized that I need to take legal action. I will soon be contacting an attorney.</h8>
